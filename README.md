# Customer-Churn-Prediction-IBM-Telco-Dataset
📊 Customer Churn Prediction – IBM Telco Dataset
🔍 Project Overview

Customer Churn Prediction is a business-focused Machine Learning project designed to identify customers who are likely to discontinue telecom services. The objective of this project is to help organizations reduce customer attrition, improve customer retention strategies, and increase long-term revenue by taking proactive actions based on data-driven insights.
This project follows a complete end-to-end industry-grade ML workflow, starting from business problem understanding to model evaluation and interpretation.

🏢 Business Problem
In the telecom industry, acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Customer churn directly impacts revenue and market share.
Business Question:
“Which customers are likely to leave the company, and what factors contribute most to churn?”

🎯 Business Objectives
Predict whether a customer will churn (Yes / No)
Identify key factors influencing churn
Enable data-driven retention strategies
Improve customer lifetime value (CLV)
Reduce revenue loss due to customer attrition

📂 Dataset Description (IBM Telco Customer Churn)
The dataset contains customer-level information, including:
Demographic data: Gender, senior citizen status, dependents
Account information: Tenure, contract type, billing method
Service usage: Internet service, phone service, add-on services
Financial data: Monthly charges, total charges
Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)
